# -Fun-Rainbowduino-codes
Fun codes that can be used to program the Rainbowduino by arduino
These are just basic codes that I created using basic commands from the Rainbowduino Wiki. I also edited code from Gilad Dayagi to make my own designs using her codes. 
I created an Low resolution LED display from http://www.instructables.com/id/Low-resolution-display-done-right/ for my class at Bluestamp engineering and used some of these codes.
You will need to download the Rainbowduino libraries and FTDI USB driver as well for these codes to work.
I also used a distance sensor with some of these codes that changes what happens on the display depending on how far away your are from the sensor. I used the HC-SR04 sensor that is compatible with Arduino
I started with 0 knowledge of programming so I know that You can do it too!
Have fun playing around with these codes and making them even better!
